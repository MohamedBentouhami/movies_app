# MoviesLand

MoviesLand is a React app that lets you search for and view movies fetched from the OMDB API. It features a responsive grid layout that displays movie posters and basic information such as title and type. This project has been inspired by a tutorial but modified and customized in my own way.

## Features

- **Search Movies**: Users can search for movies by title.
- **Responsive Design**: The app's layout adjusts based on screen size.
- **Movie Grid**: Displays movie posters and titles fetched from the OMDB API.
